Welcome to Bankist! This was a fun app that helped me practice DOM manipulation with JS. 

We have simulated a banking UI that shows transaction history, current balance, what you made and what you spent and the user first and last name. All transaction values are hard coded for simplicity. Feel free to play around with the transer money and the request loan functions. You can transfer money between the 2 (fake) accounts that are offered. You can use the login function and you have a choice of using user:JS pin:1111 and user:JD pin:2222. Once you login and transfer money, you can see it in the transaction history and current account on both accounts!! pretty cool stuff. 

All forms on the page work as well as closing an account and requesting a loan with an interest rate. Just refresh the page to start over and login to switch between accounts or reset the transaction history. 

I have a great deal of fun making this project, please enjoy.
